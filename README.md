# Objective

Build a simple dashboard that displays a table or a line graph with data from a specific data set.

## Features

Based on user inputs, the dashboard can:
* Swap the visualization between table and the line graph
* Filter the data set by "date" or "state" (the dataset to be used is located in folder `assets`)

## Conditions

* The dataset must be transferred by script to a NoSQL database
* The dashboard should pull the data from the database, ONLY once.
* The dashboard should run on React
* All other frameworks/packages are open to the developer
